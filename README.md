Single Page Application in Javascript with Pinterest-look-alike-layouts

This is a front end application that consumes data from an API (https://test-prod-api.herokuapp.com/products) to display product information.

The grids are arranged in columns depending on the browser width and the shortest column available at that point.

How to setup:

Run a local webserver or you can simply double-click index.html.

Notes:

You could run a node server or python server.

Node Server : https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
Python Server : python3 -m http.server (Python3)
                python -m SimpleHTTPServer (Lower Versions)
